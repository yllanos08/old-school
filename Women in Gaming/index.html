    <h3> The Problem </h3>
    <!-- MAIN TEXT -->
    <p id = "problemText"> Sexism is extremely prevalent throughout both the gaming community and the gaming industry. As a girl who plays online video games regularly, I have run into my fair share of hateful comments and "jokes". Half of the time, I don't even speak in voice chat so that I don't have to deal with the toxic comments and behavior. Studies show that 77% of women who play video games have experienced gender-based discrimination when playing. Why should women have to worry about being harassed when enjoying a simple hobby? Below is the first video in an 18 part series called "OMG A GIRL" made by Spawntaneous. She records her experiences playing an online game called Rainbow Six Siege. While watching you will see multiple examples of what it can be like playing video games as a woman. Be aware, there is some foul and abusive language throughout the video.   <p>

    <h3> The Activision Blizzard Lawsuit </h3>
    <p> On July 20, 2021, California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DEFH) filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard. This is due to the “frat boy” culture which led to multiple accounts of sexual harassment and discrimination against women in the workplace. In 2019 many female employees quit “due to sexual harassment and sexism”. Blizzard Entertainment’s former president J. Allen Brack apparently knew about this yet never really did anything about it. Brack eventually resigned on August 3, 2021. You can read more about it on <a href = "https://www.polygon.com/22608372/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-explainer-sexual-harassment-frat-boy-discrimination-gender-fired" target = "_blank"> polygon.com</a> and <a href = "https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-22-state-of-california-sues-activision-blizzard-over-frat-boy-culture" target = "_blank"> eurogamer.net</a>.
