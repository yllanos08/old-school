        <p  class = "learnParagraph"> The video above (created by SVB on Youtube) talks about sexism in a game called Overwatch and gaming in general. The video mentions how toxicity is just a part of playing online games, however, the comments towards women generally tend to be much worse. They are extremely annoying and can make enjoying a hobby an uncomfortable experience.</p>
